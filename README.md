# PennStateJavaGame

20191124

Welcome to my first published Java Game! 
This was a game that I created in my Java class at Penn State using the Netbeans IDE.

Now it's not the prettiest program on planet earth but hey it was the first time I could say I made a a fully functional game. 
I've made video games in C++ but it was only in the console and was only like tic tac toe or checkers wheatever boring turn based game
I could make with some simple understanding of C++.

This was the first time I say that I was becoming a software developer of some sorts.
Upon firing up the program the game a pop up jpanel displayign the menu. 
You can read the instructions on how to play the game. 

Features
  -High Score XML recorder
  -Change the name of your hero

Later this year I will upload some older programs but for now I am done with Java
